        <h1>AVR Bootloader with Wiznet W5100 ethernet support</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>I've extended the Optiboot bootloader to add support for interfacing
        to the bootloader over TCP/IP as well as through the serial port.

        </p><p>I have a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10536"> Sparkfun
        Ethernet Pro</a> board, which is basically an Arduino Pro board
        combined with an Arduino Ethernet shield on a single board. It's based
        on an Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller and a Wiznet W5100 chip. It's a
        great little board, and it's a lot of fun to program a system which is
        both large enough to do real work and yet small enough that one can
        reasonably expect to learn how every piece of hardware works.

        </p><p>I have received reports that the Arduino Uno with the original
        Ethernet Shield is indeed compatible with this software. I have also
        used this bootstrap on an Arduino Ethernet board successfully.

        </p><p>I've never used the Arduino software suite. I use the excellent <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/"><tt>avr-libc</tt></a> together
        with <tt>avr-binutils</tt> and <tt>avr-gcc</tt>. It seems that the
        Arduino project uses these same tools so perhaps this will be useful to
        Arduino users too.

        </p><p align="center"><img src="./AVR Bootloader with Wiznet W5100 ethernet support_files/sparkfun.jpg" width="568" height="472" alt="Sparkfun Pro Ethernet board">

        </p><p>ATmega microcontrollers are typically programmed through SPI, but to
        make development more convenient the top part of flash memory (up to
        4KB on this model) can be programmed with a special "bootloader"
        program that runs on reset before the main application and can
        reprogram the rest of the flash memory when required. On Arduino boards
        this typically contains bootloader that supports loading the program
        through the serial port, using the "STK500" protocol. The RESET line of
        the microcontroller is tied to the DTR pin on the serial port, so it's
        very convenient for the developer's workstation to reset the
        microcontroller into the bootloader, and then send it a new program.

        </p><p>This is great when you have access to the serial port on the board,
        but if you've deployed a bunch of these and want to update the firmware
        on them all it could be something of a pain to go and physically touch
        each board. I have exactly this situation with a project I am working
        on for a client, and my solution to this is to extend the bootloader
        with support for loading the program over TCP/IP.

        </p><p>For (hopefully obvious!) security reasons I have not made it
        possible to reset the AVR into ethernet bootloader mode without the
        co-operation of the running application. The application is responsible
        for authenticating any such request before executing it.

        </p><p>The Wiznet W5100 is a remarkable little chip. It combines a
        10/100Mbit full duplex ethernet interface with a full hardwired TCP/IP
        stack and 8KB of internal data buffers all accessed over the 4-wire SPI
        protocol. The device is limited to four concurrent TCP or UDP
        conversations, but this is more than enough for most embedded
        applications. The device does not support IPv6, only IPv4. Because so
        much of the network stack is implemented on the chip, the interface to
        the microcontroller is sufficiently simple that it can be implemented
        in very little code.

        </p><h2>Operation</h2>

        <p>My bootloader is based on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/optiboot/">Optiboot</a> and in most
        circumstances it behaves exactly as Optiboot does. There are three main
        changes;

        </p><ul>

        <li>The bootloader is 1024 bytes rather than 512 bytes.  The additional
        flash memory is required for the extra code to support the W5100.
        There is also a 2048 byte version which is faster but has otherwise identical
        functionality.

        </li><li>A new STK500 command (operation code "N") causes the bootloader to
        respond with a two-byte acknowledgement ("OK") and then restart itself
        in ethernet mode. This is useful primarily for testing the bootloader
        when you have access to the serial port.

        </li><li>The EEPROM contains all the configuration required for ethernet
        support. The MAC address, IP address, subnet mask and gateway are
        stored in EEPROM. In addition, one byte is a flag used to indicate that
        when it is next run the bootloader should listen for a programmer
        connecting over TCP/IP rather than on the serial port.

        </li></ul>

        <p>You can upload programs through the serial port exactly as you
        normally would, because without a special flag in EEPROM the serial
        port is used in preference to the ethernet port. This means that you
        can develop your application exactly as you normally would.

        </p><p>To trigger the ethernet mode of the bootloader, you have two options:

        </p><ul>

            <li>Reset the device and then send the letter 'N' to the serial
            port during this 500ms window. The device will respond with "OK"
            and then restart in ethernet mode. This is intended primarily for
            testing since if you can access the serial port you can presumably
            just upload your program using the serial port!

            </li><li>Have your application write 0x55 to offset 0x22 in the EEPROM,
            and then restart the device. This is the mode intended for
            production use.

        </li></ul>

        <p>Once in ethernet mode, you can use <tt>avrdude</tt> to program an
        updated application over TCP/IP. The device will listen for a
        connection for about ten minutes. If no connection is received it will
        reboot the device and run the application normally. The device listens
        on TCP port 61440, so you want to do something like this (replace
        "192.168.100.233" with the IP of your device):

        </p><pre class="code">avrdude -p atmega328p -c arduino -P net:192.168.100.233:61440 -U firmware.hex</pre>

        <p>After a connection is opened, the device will reboot itself if no
        traffic is received for around 8 seconds.

        </p><p>When entering the bootloader in serial mode, the LED connected to
        pin B5 (labelled "L" on the Sparkfun board) flashes twice. When
        entering the bootloader in ethernet mode, the LED flashes five times.
        The LED flashes slightly faster than it does in the normal Optiboot
        bootloader; just think of the milliseconds you'll save.

        </p><h2>Application code</h2>

        <p>To support remote updating, you need to modify your application so
        it can accept a command over the network and boot itself into the
        bootloader in ethernet mode. I assume that your application already
        implements some sort of network protocol, so you just need to add a new
        command and ensure that only privileged operators can execute it.

        </p><p>When the bootloader starts up, it checks a flag byte at address
        0x22 in EEPROM. If this byte contains value 0x55, it rewrites the
        EEPROM byte to 0xFF (so the bootloader will run in the normal serial
        mode again next time). It then initialises the ethernet interface using
        the configuration in EEPROM and waits for an incoming TCP/IP
        connection. It will wait for about ten minutes before giving up and rebooting.
        
        </p><p>The application code to achieve this is very simple:
</p><pre class="code">#include &lt;avr/eeprom.h&gt;
#include &lt;avr/wdt.h&gt;

void reboot_to_ethernet_bootloader(void)
{
    eeprom_write_byte((uint8_t*)0x22, 0x55); // set bootloader flag
    wdt_enable(WDTO_15MS);                   // 15ms watchdog delay
    while(1);                                // loop forever until watchdog resets us
}</pre> 

        <h2>EEPROM layout</h2>

        <p>The configuration is stored in EEPROM between addresses 0x10 and
        0x22. The ordering of fields in the EEPROM may seem a bit random
        but this was selected to match the ordering of registers in the W5100
        and thus reduce the bootloader size by allowing the full configuration
        to be loaded by a single loop.

        </p><pre class="code">ADDRESS  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
0x0000  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
0x0010  GG GG GG GG SS SS SS SS MM MM MM MM MM MM II II
0x0020  II II BB -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --</pre>
        <ul>
            <li><tt>--</tt> indicates an unused byte
            </li><li><tt>BB</tt>: address 0x22, 1 byte: Bootloader flag (0x55: ethernet mode, anything else: serial mode)
            </li><li><tt>MM</tt>: address 0x18, 6 bytes: MAC address of the device
            </li><li><tt>II</tt>: address 0x1E, 4 bytes: IPv4 address of the device
            </li><li><tt>SS</tt>: address 0x14, 4 bytes: Subnet mask of the device
            </li><li><tt>GG</tt>: address 0x10, 4 bytes: Gateway address
        </li></ul>

        <p>Note that, like optiboot, this bootloader does not support
        programming the EEPROM. The simple solution to this problem is to
        either use an ISP programmer, or write a small program that programs
        the EEPROM for you, upload that and run it. Here's <a href="https://sowerbutts.com/optiboot-w5100/eeprom-writer.c">one I made earlier</a>; it's not pretty, but it works.

        </p><h2>Faster programming option</h2>

        <p>There are two versions of my bootloader. The first fits into 1KB
        flash and is about 20% faster than using RS232 at 115,200bps to
        reprogram the device.  The second fits into 2KB flash and is about
        twice as fast as the 1KB version.

        </p><p>Both versions are built from a single source code file and they have
        identical functionality. The only difference is the amount of flash
        memory that they use and the speed of programming. The reason for the
        difference is that the 1K bootloader always reads or writes one byte at
        a time from the W5100, while the 2K bootloader reads or writes in
        larger blocks when it can. The additional code required to do block
        reads and writes pushes us over the 1KB limit.

        </p><p>My intention is primarily to produce a bootloader that I can use to
        upgrade devices once they have been deployed in the field, which should
        be a very rare operation, and so I recommend the 1KB bootloader since
        it gets the job done at a reasonable speed and leaves a little more
        flash memory free for my program. The 2KB version is there as an option
        if you're a complete speed freak.

        </p><p>I suspect with some clever optimising it would be possible to fit
        the block read/write code into the 1KB bootloader. Patches welcome!

        </li></ul>

        <p>I release my changes to Optiboot under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL 2</a> license.

        </p><p>To rebuild the bootloader, use the <tt>build</tt> script included with
        the source. This will build both the 1KB and 2KB ("fat") bootloaders.
    
        </p><p>To program the bootloader you need an ISP programmer (ie one that
        talks to the device over SPI; you cannot reprogram the bootloader using
        a bootloader). To program the flash and set the fuses correctly for a
        1KB bootloader on an ATmega328P with my STK200 programmer I use: 
        
        </p><pre class="code">avrdude -p m328p -c stk200 -P /dev/parport0 \
        -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xd4:m -U efuse:w:0x05:m \
        -U flash:w:./optiboot_atmega328.hex</pre>

        <p>The command to flash the 2KB bootloader is in the README file inside
        the source.

        </p><p>Note that on the Sparkfun board the W5100 always drives the SPI port
        which may interfere with programming the ATmega; you need to pull the
        <tt>SEN</tt> pin low on the W5100 to make it to tri-state. On the
        Sparkfun board there is a solder jumper on the rear of the device
        (labelled "PROG") which does exactly this. You need to close this
        jumper, flash the bootloader, then open the jumper again. I found that
        in practice my 5V programmer was strong enough to override the signals
        from the W5100 without closing the jumper ... but it's probably not
        optimal for the health of the hardware.

        </p><h2>Caveats</h2>

        <p>If you've not flashed a bootloader before, backup your existing
        bootloader (flash and fuse settings) first. You can use <tt>avrdude</tt> to read out the contents
        of the flash and fuse memories first, and program them back later if it
        all goes wrong (to program them back, change the "<tt>:r:</tt>" for "<tt>:w:</tt>" in each command):

        </p><pre class="code">avrdude -p m328p -c stk200 -P /dev/parport0 -U flash:r:flashrom.hex:i
avrdude -p m328p -c stk200 -P /dev/parport0 -U eeprom:r:eeprom.hex:i
avrdude -p m328p -c stk200 -P /dev/parport0 -U lfuse:r:lfuse.hex:i
avrdude -p m328p -c stk200 -P /dev/parport0 -U efuse:r:efuse.hex:i
avrdude -p m328p -c stk200 -P /dev/parport0 -U hfuse:r:hfuse.hex:i</pre>

        <p>When in bootloader mode, the device will accept the first incoming
        connection it gets on port 61440. If this is from someone other than
        you, you lose. Don't use this on public networks.

        </p><p>If you're going to reprogram a remote device, be sure that the code
        actually works before you program it. Because the bootloader only
        enters ethernet mode when the flag in EEPROM is configured
        appropriately, and it turns off the flag immediately, and the
        application is the only thing that can write to that EEPROM, you need a
        working application to accept the command to enter remote programming
        mode. If you flash a broken application, you'll need to go and
        reprogram the device over serial or using the ISP header.

        </p><p>If you break your hardware, you get to keep both bits.

        </p><p>This software comes with <b>NO WARRANTY</b>, explicit or implied.

        </p><h2>Further extensions</h2>

        <p>The code fits neatly into 1KB; there's 34 bytes free for 17
        additional instructions.  There is ample space (over 800 bytes) free
        inside the 2KB bootloader.
        
        </p><p>If you want to free up a little space in the 1KB bootloader, my
        suggestion is to get rid of the code for flashing the LED and
        configuring pin B5 as an output—this will save you about 36
        bytes. Then I would get rid of the new 'N' bootloader command, which is
        really only useful for testing. After that you're on your own to search
        for further optimisations.

        </p><p>One improvement I have considered is having the device open a
        connection to an address and port configured in EEPROM rather than
        listening for an incoming connection. This largely resolves the present
        security risk whereby there is a race to connect to the TCP port on the
        device. Unfortunately <tt>avrdude</tt> doesn't support listening for an
        incoming connection, as far as I can see. If you fancy patching
        <tt>avrdude</tt> then I suspect there would be just about enough space
        to jam the additional code into the 1KB version. There is certainly
        space in the 2KB version.
